The application was developed in parallel with the course, which can be found at this link:
`https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcvhF2Wqh7DNVy1OCUpG3i5lyxyBWhGZ8`.

The idea of the app is that each beginner developer uses the same database to learn frontEnd development. As he develops the application, he uploads data about himself to the shared server database. When development is complete, he or she will see a shared pool of developers who have done the same thing, according to the course.

The authorized user has the ability to change status and information about himself.
